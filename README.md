### GoFit

GoFit is a simple service to ingest and explore time series data. It was initially created to browse
Garmin TCX data collected from [Google Fit](https://fit.google.com) and then enhanced to support generic data sets. 
GoFit uses the excellent Gonum [plot](https://github.com/gonum/plot) library to generate dynamic charts,
[Gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) as an ORM, and [gorilla](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/) mux router.
